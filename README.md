# XenForo-ISO
The XenForo ISO Add-on.

This Add-on:
 * Shows entire posts in search results, complete with images, quotes, and styles.
 * Adds a link below each user's miniprofile linking to a search of all their posts in the current thread.

## Installation
1. Backup the original versions of files in the `library/XenForo/Search/DataHandler/` directory. The files that will be overwritten are core XenForo files. In case there are conflicts or you wish to uninstall this Add-on, you will need copies of the originals to go back to.
2. Upload the contents of the `upload/` directory to the root of your XenForo installation. Overwrite any existing copies.
3. Install the Add-on using the `.xml` file using the `Install Add-on` page in the Admin Control Panel for your XenForo installation.

## Use
1. Go to any thread.
2. Observe the `Isolate Posts by {Username}` button below the user's profile in each post. Click one.
3. Enjoy the rich search results filtered by user *and* thread with no cutoff for character counts.
